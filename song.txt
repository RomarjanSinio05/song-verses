When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special
You float like a feather  
In a beautiful world  
I wish I was special  
You're so f***ing special
Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
